# Inhabitent Project for RED Academy

**Project Name:** Inhabitent Camping Supply Co.
**Modified by:** Jason "Showwtime" Murphy
**Description:** This is a multipage WordPress website for an outdoors supply company called Inhabitent Camping Supply Co.



**To Do's:** As you can see, i still have a lot of work to do. 
**Technologies used:** We used WP themes, a lot of HTML/CSS, PHP, and some Javascript to make this happen.


## Installation

### 1. Download me (don't clone me!)

Then add me to your `wp-content` directory.


### 2. Install the dev dependencies

Next you'll need to run `npm install` **inside your theme directory** next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.

This Project has been a test of patience and class learnings.
